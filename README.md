# .github

This GitHub organization was created as part of an undergraduate Senior Project course.

The project itself was primarily developed using Microsoft's Power Platform (Power Apps, Power Automate, and related services), permitted by our sponsor's requirements. As a result, traditional GitHub version control was not necessary for the project's main deliverables throughout development, although we do have the finished source code here.

An overview of the project is available at: [https://sites.google.com/view/06-t2-coaprocessing-website/home].
