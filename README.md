# .github

This GitHub organization was created as part of an undergraduate Senior Project course.

The project itself was primarily developed using Microsoft's Power Platform (Power Apps, Power Automate, and related services), in alignment with our sponsor's specifications. As a result, traditional GitHub version control was not necessary for the project's main deliverables.

An overview of the project is available at: [website link].
